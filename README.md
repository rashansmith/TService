# TService

This repository contains code relating to the Ticket Service Assignment. 
In the short amount of time, effort was made towards creating a Level and 
SeatHolder class. To get a MVP seating was subtracted from the total amount
of seats and not individual seats. In addition, I was not able to get to the 
reserveSeats method. Hopefully during our discussion I can go into depth into 
how I would implement those imcomplete features.
